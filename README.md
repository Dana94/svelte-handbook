# Welcome!

I wrote this book to help you quickly learn Svelte and get familiar with how it works.

The ideal reader of the book has zero knowledge of Svelte, has maybe used Vue or React, but is looking for something _more_, or a new approach to things.

I find Svelte is very well worth looking into, because it provides a refreshing point of view and several unique features to the Web.

Thank you for getting this ebook. I hope it will help you learn more about Svelte!
