I hope this little handbook was useful to shine a light on what Svelte can do for you, and I hope you are now interested to learn more about it!

I can now point you to two places to learn more:


- [The official Svelte website](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), an awesome framework built on top of Svelte that lets you build SSR apps with Node.js and Svelte

That's it!

I can point you to my website [flaviocopes.com](https://flaviocopes.com) if you are interested in learning more, I publish one new tutorial every day and I'll be posting more Svelte guides soon!
